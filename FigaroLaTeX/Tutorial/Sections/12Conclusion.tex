As you can see, there's quite a lot to Figaro. We hope you will find it useful in your probabilistic reasoning projects. If you have any comments, suggestions, bug fixes, etc., please refer to the GitHub site (\url{https://github.com/p2t2}) for the best way to contact us, or send them to figaro@cra.com.

Some of the planned next steps for Figaro are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Better dynamic reasoning algorithms
\item Distributed reasoning algorithms
\end{itemize}

If you have any suggestions to make along these lines or about other possible next steps, we would love to hear from you. If you want to make a contribution, we would be delighted.

Thanks for reading, and enjoy!
