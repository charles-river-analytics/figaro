/**
 * Algorithms that compute probability of evidence.
 * The evidence is specified as a list of named Evidence items.
 * In addition to the universe, the ProbEvidenceAlgorithm takes two optional arguments. The evidence, which defaults to empty, and the denominator, which defaults to 1.
 * The evidence is a list of specific evidence items associated with references.
 * When started, the algorithm computes the probability of the named evidence, in addition to the conditions and constraints in the model, divided by the denominator (partition function).
 * In a typical use case, one might want to compute the probability of the named evidence, taking the conditions and constraints as a given part of the model.
 * To achieve this, you would create a ProbEvidenceAlgorithm with no evidence to compute the probability of the conditions and constraints. This probability becomes the
 * denominator in a subsequent algorithm that takes the named evidence whose probability you want to compute.
 * Several shortcut ways of achieving this are provided.
