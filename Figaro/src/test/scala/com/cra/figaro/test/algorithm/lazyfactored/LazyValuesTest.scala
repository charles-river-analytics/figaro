       * This test is tricky. We want to count the number of times the function inside the chain is called while computing
       * values. It must be a non-caching chain, since a caching chain would memoize the function anyway even if values
       * wasn't working correctly, so it wouldn't have a good test. The parent must have at least two values, because even
       * a non-caching chain does not recompute the function if the parent value hasn't changed. So, we make the parent
       * have two values. The final trick is to make sure that the first parent value is the current value when values is
       * called on the chain, so we know the function is not recomputed the first time, and is only recomputed for the
       * second parent value. That way, we can be sure the function should only be called once in the first call to
       * values. Since values is memoized, the function should not be called at all in subsequent times, so the total
       * number of times it is called should be 1.
