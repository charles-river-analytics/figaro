/**
 * Abstract class that runs the Factored Frontier algorithm.
 * Like a particle filter, the algorithm is supplied with models representing initial and static universes, as well as a universe transition function.
 *
 * At each time step, the algorithm copies the marginal probabilities for each named element to a new dummy universe.
 * This dummy universe is then supplied to the transition function.
 *
 * @param static The universe of elements that do not change over time.
 * @param initial The universe describing the distribution over the initial state of the system.
 * @param transition The transition model describing how the current state of the system depends on the static and previous, respectively.
