/**
 * Trait Distance
 *
 * Classes that are used as decision parents in the approximate decision strategies
 * (i.e., they use Nearest Neighbor querying to compute optimal decisions) must
 * implement the Distance trait. This is so that the distance between two parent values
 * can be easily computed.
 *
 * For the built in classes Double, Int and Boolean, implicit conversions to Distance
 * are already provided, and the user does not need to do anything. The default also
 * handles two tuple parents of the same base type using the L2 distance
 *
 * For any user defined types as a parent, they must implement the Distance trait,
 * and define the function distance(that:T) which defines how to compute the distance
 * between two instances of the class. If a user uses any combination of tuples other
 * than 2-tuples of Int, Boolean or Double, they must define the tuple distance as well.
 * See TupleDistance2 below for an example.
