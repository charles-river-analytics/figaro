/**
 * Algorithms can be instructed to use an abstraction scheme to reason about an element (see
 * AbstractionScheme.scala). This is achieved by adding an Abstraction pragma to the element. This pragma
 * can be created most simply by calling Abstraction(numAbstractPoints), which specifies the desired number
 * of abstract points for the abstraction. If an implicit abstraction scheme has been defined for the type
 * of element, it will be used implicitly here. Otherwise, to specify that scheme should be used, call
 * Abstraction(numAbstractPoints)(scheme).
 *
 * Abstraction also takes an optional second argument, which is numConcretePointsPerAbstractPoint. This
 * argument is used to generate the sample concrete points from which the abstract points are selected, in
 * case the full set of concrete points cannot be generated (e.g., for continuous elements). The value of
 * this argument is multiplied by the number of abstract points to determine the total number of concrete
 * points. The default value for this argument is 10.This is indicated by attaching an Abstraction to the
 * element.
