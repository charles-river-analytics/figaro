/**
 * The general class of filtering algorithms. A filtering algorithm is provided with an initial model,
 * represented by a universe encoding the probability distribution over the initial state,
 * and a transition model, which maps a state to a universe encoding the probability distribution
 * over the new state. An implementation of Filtering must implement the advanceTime,
 * computeCurrentDistribution, and computeCurrentExpectation methods.
 * 
 * Querying and asserting evidence to a filtering algorithm are done using references. This is because references are stable over time,
 * while the particular elements they refer to are not.
 * 
 * @param static A static universe that other universes may depend upon.
 * @param initial The initial universe.
 * @param transition A transition function from a universe at the old time step to a new.
