/**
 * Parallel version of a sampling algorithm. Has a parallel collection of algorithm instances 
 * that will do its work on separate threads, over separate universes. Uses Scala's parallel 
 * collections to divide up the work, so it will work best if told to run on a number of threads 
 * less than or equal to the number of worker threads Scala creates when operating over parallel 
 * collections. 
 * 
 * This creates two major differences with how a user interacts with the algorithm. First of all, 
 * rather than defining a model on a universe and then starting the algorithm, the user must 
 * define a function that generates a universe and applies any evidence, and then pass that to 
 * the companion object to create the algorithm. The second major difference is that elements 
 * must be referred to using references, since each variable will exist as multiple elements 
 * across the different universes.
 * 
 * One-time sampling will be faster, since it divides the work over the different threads. 
 * Anytime sampling should provide more accurate results, since it can take more samples over 
 * the same amount of time. Both cases will most likely require more memory, at least using the 
 * current implementation of WeightedSampler, which keeps track of all values and weights that 
 * have been sampled. When querying, a weighted combination of the results of the various threads 
 * is returned. This last step adds some overhead, which should be negligible as long as you are 
 * taking a large number of samples.
