 *  observations. To avoid this, we keep track of all these dependencies.
 *  The dependencies map contains all the elements that could propagate an
 *  observation to any given element.
 *  Note: the dependencies map is only concerned with active elements that are present 
 *  at the beginning of sampling (even though we get a new active elements list each sample).
 *  Temporary elements will always be created after the element that could propagate
 *  an observation to them, because that propagation has to go through a permanent 
 *  element.
 *  Therefore, we can generate the dependencies map once before all the samples are generated.
