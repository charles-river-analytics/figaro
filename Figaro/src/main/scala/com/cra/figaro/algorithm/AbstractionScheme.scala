/**
 * In an abstraction, the values of an element are reduced to a smaller, abstract set of values. Each
 * concrete value is mapped to a specific abstract value. Algorithms might choose to operate on the abstract
 * values rather than the concrete values.
 *
 * Elements that undergo an abstraction use an abstraction scheme to govern it. The abstraction scheme
 * consists of two methods. The first, select, determines the representative points for the abstraction to
 * which all points are mapped. The second, map, maps a point to one of the representative points.
 *
 * The map method is actually included in the PointMapper trait that AbstractionScheme extends. All elements
 * have a PointMapper, not just those that undergo an abstraction. This can be used in the implementation of
 * algorithms (see, e.g., Factor.scala). The implicit PointMapper is one that maps every point to itself, so
 * it can safely be used for every element that does not undergo an abstraction.
 *
 * Probably the most common type of abstraction is discretization of continuous elements. 
 * Currently the RegularDiscretization scheme is implemented, which uses evenly space abstract point.
 * There is an implicit abstraction scheme for Double elements using RegularDiscretization 
 * so one does not have to be specified explicitly.
