/**
 * Pragmas are hints to algorithms that are associated with elements. A Pragma is parameterized by the type parameter
 * of the element to which it is attached. Pragmas are added to elements using Element's addPragma method. More
 * recently added pragmas can shadow older pragmas of the same type. Pragmas can be removed using Element's
 * removePragma method.
