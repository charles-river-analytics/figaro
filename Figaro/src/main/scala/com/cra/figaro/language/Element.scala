/**
 * An Element is the core component of a probabilistic model. Elements can be understood as
 * defining a probabilistic process. Elements are parameterized by the type of Value the process
 * produces.
 *
 * Each Element is a mix of a random component and a deterministic component. The random component
 * has type Randomness. The generateRandomness method generates the Randomness according to a
 * probability distribution. The generateValue method is a deterministic function that generates the
 * output Value of the Element from the Randomness. Thus, Elements can be understood as defining a
 * generative process in which first the Randomness is generated and then the output Value is
 * generated given the Randomness.
 *
 * Elements also have a current outcome, represented by the value field. Naturally, the
 * generateValue function can refer to the current value of related Elements. However, generateValue
 * is not allowed to call generateValue on another Element. We use the notation generateValue(r | w)
 * to denote the value it produces given randomness r when the current value of related Elements is
 * w.
 *
 * Elements can have hard conditions and soft constraints. A condition is a predicate on Values that
 * must be satisfied by the output of the Element. Values that violate the condition have
 * probability zero. A constraint is a function that maps Values to Doubles. The probability of a
 * Value is multiplied by the constraint, and then normalized.
 * Conditions and constraints can be contingent on other elements taking on particular values.
 * Ordinarily, these contingencies will not be specified by the user, but automatically by other Figaro code.
 * In particular, specifying named evidence on a reference can result in contingencies.
 *
 * Thus, an Element represents a conditional probability distribution over Values given the current
 * values w of related Elements. The probability of an outcome v is defined by:
 *
 *   P(v | w) is proportional to (\sum_{r: generateValue(r | w) = v} P(generateRandomness() = r)
 *                                                       * constraint(v))             if condition(v);
 *                    0                                                              otherwise
 *
 * An element has a name and belongs to an element collection that is used to find the element the name.
 * 
 * Elements can be cacheable or non-cacheable, which determines what type of Chain will be created for them.
 * If you create a new Element class that you want to be cached, you should declare it to implement the Cachable or IfArgsCachable traits.
 *
 * @param name The name of the element
 * @param collection The element collection to which this element belongs
