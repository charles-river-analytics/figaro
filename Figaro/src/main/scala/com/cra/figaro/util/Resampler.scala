  // When we sample a uniform random number, we search for the greatest key that is less than or equal to it. The
  // probability of choosing a key will then be equal to the difference between the key and the next one up, which
  // by construction is the desired probability of the sample.
  // A TreeMap is used to provide log n insertion and search.
  // Java's TreeMap is used because it provides floorEntry, which lets us find the right key.
