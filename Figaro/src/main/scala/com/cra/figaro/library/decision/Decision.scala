/**
 * A Decision class represents a decision that takes in a single parent element, applies a function (aka a policy)
 * on the value of the parent, and returns a decision element. A decision is essentially a chain, with the added
 * capability to change the function in the chain. If your decision has more than one parent, you can create an element
 * tuple of the parents and use the tuple as the input to the decision
 *
 */
/*
 * 
 * Inside each decision class is a DecisionPolicy class. The DecisionPolicy class controls how the optimal
 * decision for each parent value is chosen. Generally the default policy algorithm will work for most people,
 * but they can be override if necessary. The decision class extends PolicyMaker, which controls how to create
 * a DecisionPolicy for a decision. The default implementations of decisions automatically extend
 * PolicyMaker as appropriate. If you want a different DecisionPolicy, you need to extend the trait
 * PolicyMaker and declare the function makePolicy.
 *
 * There are two types of chains. A caching version and a noncaching version. The caching should only be used
 * on domains where the parents values are discrete and have a small range, and it implements an exact policy
 * (i.e., during decision inference, it must compute a policy for every possible value of parents). The
 * noncaching uses an approximate policy algorithm (based on kNN) and should be used for continuous
 * parents or discrete parents with a very large range.
